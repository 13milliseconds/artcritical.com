<p><strong>¬†</strong></p>
<p><strong>How important to you is the actual landscape you depict?</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôm more interested in the painting problems than the descriptive aspect.</p>
<p><strong>Is landscape a metaphor for what is happening in the painting process?</strong></p>
<p>It‚Äôs a pretext.</p>
<p><strong>No different to a still-life object then?</strong></p>
<p>It‚Äôs better than a still-life because there‚Äôs much more movement in there. In fact if you make it too static it‚Äôll no longer feel like a landscape. I suppose I care much more about a landscape than I wish to let on. But I‚Äôm also terribly aware that landscape as a genre has been debased over the last fifty years so that there is very little possibility of doing something that has, say, an ideological, religious or nationalistic meaning, all of which were apropos in the nineteenth century. At this point the only meaning I can really assign to it is painterly. It‚Äôs still a wonderful tradition in art; there are so many good examples of how to do it right that you can still get very excited over it. And of course, if you‚Äôre not excited about going out into nature you‚Äôre not alive. The two of them have to meet somewhere. I try to make them meet in my painting.</p>
<p><strong>Did your boyhood in Germany expose you to a special sense of landscape and nature?</strong></p>
<p>And how!¬† The Germans have this thing about nature, woods especially, which is deeply embedded in the culture. I grew up with that. Every weekend we‚Äôd take what is called an <em>Ausflug</em>, a trip to the country. It‚Äôs part of my tradition.</p>
<p><strong>Yet at the same time don‚Äôt you feel that the German romantic sense of landscape is historically tainted with nationalistic overtones?</strong></p>
<p>German landscape painting never interested me. All the fuss over Caspar David Friedrich seems to be misplaced. As paintings I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre very interesting. The guy with his frock coat and big hat standing in front of a scene with his arms outstretched: all that rhetoric gets on my nerves. I like to take things for granted. To inflate things with rhetoric is wrong. All you have to do is put down two colors and you‚Äôre way past all rhetoric, if you‚Äôre doing it right.</p>
<p><strong>That‚Äôs quite a formalist position.</strong></p>
<p>Well, I‚Äôm a formalist painter. I‚Äôm a student of Hans Hofmann, and probably a rather faithful one. I‚Äôve never really found any reason to ditch any of his ideas, which I still find perfectly useful. They were well thought-out and profound. I don‚Äôt think what‚Äôs around today is in any way superior.</p>
<p><strong>But did Hofmann tolerate landscape painting?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. He did it himself, until he was fifty years old. There are paintings he did in Provincetown in Summer 1946 that are very recognizable landscapes.</p>
<p><strong>But wasn‚Äôt there a sense under his tutelage that the future of art lay in abstraction?</strong></p>
<p>A great thing about Hofmann is that he never thought in large categories. He dealt with the job at hand. What ever you were interested in, he‚Äôd tell you to try and do it as well as you could. Someone asked him if they should take a course in anatomy and Hofmann said ‚ÄúIf you need it in your painting, of course‚Äù. Ideologically he had no axes to grind, except he wanted his students to understand that there is a mainstream in art, and not to hew too far away from it.</p>
<p><strong>I‚Äôm still not convinced that landscape is just expedient. There must be some very deep draw, as you‚Äôve spent the best part of your career doing it.</strong></p>
<p>The deepest draw is, I know how to do it. You do what you can. I always drew well. Early in my career I tried everything: I wanted to be the kind of artist, like Van Gogh or C√©zanne, who could paint anything, subsuming it under one‚Äôs own style. I did landscapes, figures, portraits, still lifes, interiors. But it turned out the only theme where I really had something personal, a sense of freedom and the possibility of growth, was landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Landscape in itself entails freedom and growth.</strong></p>
<p>To me it does. First of all, of all the kinds of representational subject matter, it encourages you to feel the most cavalier about description. If you need an extra branch on a tree, add an extra branch. If you‚Äôre painting a figure you‚Äôd end up with a three-legged person that way. I don‚Äôt like upsetting the apple cart. From the point of view of keeping your painting flexible and allowing all possibilities to emerge, I think landscape is the best. What I have to say in landscape comes out of my love of color, and my love of paint.</p>
<p><strong>You studied with Hofmann, you have a love of color and of paint for its own sake, and you‚Äôre drawn to a subject that offers the most liberty and flexibility. It begs the question: why is landscape more conducive to you than abstraction?</strong></p>
<p>I never wanted to throw the baby out with the bathwater. I always liked to draw; I‚Äôve drawn representationally all my life, and I‚Äôm very good at it. It seemed to me that to jettison that was going too far. I admire De Kooning, who could draw like an angel but nevertheless threw it over, but he was at a moment in history when abstraction was a conquest; at this point it no longer is. It‚Äôs more a conquest to keep landscape going.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anyone else around right now who you‚Äôd rate as a landscape painter?</strong></p>
<p>Rackstraw Downes, Wayne Thiebaud, Frank Auerbach, Anselm Kiefer, Alex Katz. That‚Äôs just off the top of my head. I‚Äôm not a good man for lists. If I sat down I could probably come up with fifty people whose hand I‚Äôd gladly shake.</p>
<p><strong>There is an interesting point of comparison between yourself and Alex Katz, who you mention. He‚Äôs a painter with obvious affinities with an American realist tradition who nonetheless had the ambition to paint on the same terms as the New York School. Was that your situation too?</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôm not ambitious in the way Alex is. One of my gods is Bonnard, and he was a fuss-pot. I love the idea that you can go over the thing again and again, go back into it, then let go.</p>
<p><strong>Do you believe in the autonomy of color, that it can exist quite independently of the objects it describes?</strong></p>
<p>I don‚Äôt think Bonnard every subscribed to that. I think he liked the idea of taking a color to an extreme position, but always gaining permission from some visual experience.</p>
<p><strong>And you do the same?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. I‚Äôm trying very hard not to be arbitrary. I think the more daring you are as a colorist the less right you have to be arbitrary. You have to take your public with you.</p>
<p><strong>The public?</strong></p>
<p>General sensibility. You can‚Äôt be doing things just because you feel like doing them, there‚Äôs got to be some sort of justification. I think it comes from the color parameters set within the picture. I try to stretch them, but at the same time I have to respect them. If you are any kind of colorist you know that somewhere behind all this there‚Äôs a kind of reason.</p>
<p><strong>I‚Äôm surprised you mention the public, or ‚Äúgeneral sensibility‚Äù. Do you feel their presence when you paint?</strong></p>
<p>No, but I‚Äôm happy to feel that they exist as a result of my painting, because I‚Äôm a very popular painter. I must be talking to somebody about something.</p>
<p><strong>Are you anxious to preserve your popularity?</strong></p>
<p>No. I‚Äôve certainly spent many more years not being popular. I‚Äôm rather surprised by it, and it would be churlish not to be pleased by it.</p>
<p><strong>It‚Äôs refreshing, and surprisingly, to hear a professional painter speak as candidly as you do about popularity and general sensibility.</strong></p>
<p>I don‚Äôt like to think of myself as being ‚Äúthe other‚Äù. There are many artists who derive great comfort from being the other. In general I‚Äôm a friendly person, I‚Äôm gregarious, I wish the world well, I‚Äôm happy that my painting elicits enthusiasm.</p>
<p><strong>The paintings certainly don‚Äôt convey any existential angst or inner turmoil.</strong></p>
<p>When I‚Äôm painting, all I am is an eye. Feelings have very little influence, except in so far as they regard my original sensibility.</p>
<p><strong>Mark-making and gesture, do they come from the eye or feelings?</strong></p>
<p>I suppose feelings, but to be conscious of where they are coming from is not going to help anything. It would make you unnecessarily self-conscious.</p>
<p><strong>In a painting like <em>In a Breeze</em>, there are some quite vehement marks.</strong></p>
<p>Vehemence comes about because I want everything to exist as strongly as it can. I don‚Äôt want to hold back, I want to use myself up.</p>
<p><strong>You say the heightened color in your painting can‚Äôt be completely improvised, that there has to be some credibility, yet it‚Äôs synthetic color, it doesn‚Äôt strictly speaking arise from observation, does it?</strong></p>
<p>It has to have some correspondence. If it&#8217;s all imagined color that doesn‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs an organic unity to it, then I‚Äôm not doing it right. It‚Äôs got to be justifiable in viewable terms. I‚Äôm not just doing it in order to make bright colors. I have a lot of followers who think that‚Äôs what my painting is about, but it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs about color harmonies. I‚Äôve done great paintings without any bright color in them at all. Look at <em>Fog Bank Out There </em>for instance.</p>
<p><strong>It‚Äôs quite colorful for a gray painting, although it&#8217;s quite gray for a Wolf Kahn.</strong></p>
<p>Well let‚Äôs face it, reticence isn‚Äôt my forte.</p>
<p><strong>You generally want to paint good weather, is that fair?</strong></p>
<p>No. Here‚Äôs a pastel of a thunder storm. When I was on the water I saw it, but there was still some sunlight hitting the trees. I saw the yellow of the trees against the black of the clouds and thought that was rather wonderful. It gave me permission to make something rather dramatic. Unless I‚Äôd had the visual experience I wouldn‚Äôt have felt justified in doing it. I made a little pastel on the spot which didn‚Äôt have nearly that much contrast. When you work on site you end up being more austere than you need to be.</p>
<p><strong>More empirical, perhaps?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that too.</p>
<p><strong>What percentage of the works you exhibit are made wholly in the landscape?</strong></p>
<p>Twenty per cent. And then another forty per cent are made directly from drawings done in the landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Should an educated eye, other than your own, be able to establish on the evidence of the work which belong in each category?</strong></p>
<p>I hope not. The ideal is to make very daring, bright, courageous paintings outside, but usually one doesn‚Äôt because there is too much going on, and nature does enforce a certain austerity. Oftentimes you see the full implication of something only when you are back in the studio.</p>
<p><strong>I love the fact that you use the word ‚Äúausterity‚Äù where others might say ‚Äúfidelity‚Äù.</strong></p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know what fidelity means. Fidelity to what?</p>
<p><strong>To what you see.</strong></p>
<p>Is ‚Äúwhat you see‚Äù what the camera sees, is it a series of objects that can be listed like things in a Sears-Roebuck catalog that happen to be thrown together, is it just an atmosphere?¬† It doesn‚Äôt mean anything, fidelity, until it‚Äôs filtered through a sensibility. The only fidelity that means anything to me is fidelity to my own highest aspirations ‚Äì to be very pretentious for once! I value the possibility of development. I want each painting to be a step towards the next painting.</p>
<p><strong>Is that to avoid mannerism?</strong></p>
<p>Mannerism would be death. I have one thing that‚Äôs in my favor in this regard: I get bored very quickly. As soon as I‚Äôve done things a few times I don‚Äôt want to do them any more. I certainly don‚Äôt want to become a manufacturer of Wolf Kahns.</p>
<p><strong>You came of age as a painter during the high watermark of abstract expressionism, yet you owe more to Impressionism.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe I‚Äôm old fashioned, I don‚Äôt know. The main thing is that I don‚Äôt want to force the issue on anything. My motto is ‚Äúfollow the brush‚Äù. If the brush ends up with Impressionism then so be it.</p>
<p><strong>You paint American landscapes, and you paint within the tradition of American landscape.</strong></p>
<p>I love Innes, Ryder, Blakelock, and the more modern American landscapists, Sheeler, sometimes Georgia O‚ÄôKeefe, Burchfield, all these people are dear friends of mine.</p>
<p><strong>What about Marsden Hartley and Milton Avery?</strong></p>
<p>Avery more than Hartley. Hartley is a very uneven painter. I knew Avery very well and even went out painting with him. He was a wonderful guy. I don‚Äôt think about him when I‚Äôm painting, though. I think about C√©zanne quite a lot, and De Kooning. I‚Äôd like to be as athletic as De Kooning ‚Äì though I‚Äôm not, as you can see. I think about people that I‚Äôm not.</p>
<p><strong>To gear you on to be something else or to comfort you for being what you are?</strong></p>
<p>I don‚Äôt need comfort. I‚Äôve made my peace with myself. But one needs brothers in arms. The feeling that other people have been similarly occupied.</p>
<p><strong>Your paintings of barns have an archetypal American feel to them. Did they suggest themselves to you as a great form, or did they have some historic or symbolic resonance?</strong></p>
<p>At one point I claimed that they are like a Greek Temple to us Americans, but now I think I painted them more for formal reasons. They are great shapes, very present, very unfussy, always planted in a very interesting way into the landscape, with one entrance high for the feed, one low for the animals.</p>
<p><strong><u>Fog Bank</u></strong><strong> is the kind of subject you might get in Hopper or Avery, but Avery at least would be much more concerned with the actual form of the sea.</strong></p>
<p>The shapes you mean?¬† I‚Äôm just as concerned with the shapes as they are, but in a different way. Avery and Hopper were working in a modernist idiom at a time when that was a tremendous conquest. At this point its commonplace, so I don‚Äôt have to think about a lot of the things that they had to. Instead I think about tiny color gradations, small modulations that give me pleasure. Going from pink through all sorts of colors to that blue down there.</p>
<p><strong>You can‚Äôt be oblivious to the fact that you are concerned with retinal pleasure, ultimately with beauty, at a time when those values seem very suspect in the artworld.</strong></p>
<p>Such considerations are uninteresting because they don‚Äôt help me with my work, and who knows, next year the whole thing might change. We‚Äôre talking about matters of taste that have nothing to do with eternal values.</p>
<p><strong>But surely at any historic moment there are going to be some painters who have a sense of moving the language forward and others who enjoy a contentment which allows them to take great delectation within the terms that are set.</strong></p>
<p>I probably belong more within the second category. I work within my limitations. You can‚Äôt force yourself to be more original than you are; at the same time, you can develop your normal proclivities and make the most of them. I‚Äôm not smugly sitting back and looking at my work and saying, Gee, isn‚Äôt it beautiful?¬† That‚Äôs not my style at all. I worry about it just as much as anybody. I think about just the problems you raised earlier: What excuse is there for making landscape paintings at this moment in history when there is no real ideology to back it up. And yet, people love it and I love to do it. Maybe that‚Äôs enough. Who knows?¬† Then again, maybe the fact that it is problematical shows in my paintings. My attitude when I‚Äôm working on them is questioning all the time.</p>
<p><strong>But answering lots of minute questions, rather than the big one.</strong></p>
<p>I hate big questions, it‚Äôs not my nature at all.</p>
<p><strong>But you seem to like big painting [looking at a large work in progress].</strong></p>
<p>No, I don‚Äôt like big paintings. I‚Äôm doing this because I have a brand new big studio. I‚Äôve had that same painting in the same space for the last three years. Every now and then I wipe my brushes on it. I haven‚Äôt taken it to any conclusions. My favorite size is 36&#215;52 (inches). That‚Äôs where I feel most comfortable. Any yet I know sometimes that I can do things on a larger scale that the smaller works won‚Äôt allow me.</p>
<p><strong>It is interesting to see a painting on the easel which is in process. How long have you been working on that?</strong></p>
<p>Probably about five hours.</p>
<p><strong>What we see is half a dozen or so trees in a space which will probably be filled by several dozen.</strong></p>
<p>Certainly there‚Äôll be the hint of even more. Eventually I‚Äôll want it to be a full painting, filled with happening.</p>
<p><strong>There‚Äôs already a lot of energy at this early stage, the way that orange shows against the purple.</strong></p>
<p>You start off with something that‚Äôs going to get you going. I start out with strong relations. I can always tone them down. It‚Äôs very difficult to start with something toned down and then work it up to something outrageous.</p>
<p><strong>The eye can become so acclimatized to brilliant, shocking contrasts of color within your work, pinks against yellows, oranges against purples, that when we get nursery colors, the pale green of your grass for instance, the effect is quite exquisite.</strong></p>
<p>That‚Äôs a nice word. I‚Äôm not trying to be exquisite, but if one is one shouldn‚Äôt sniff at it.</p>
<p><strong>It sounds like you are making conscious formal decisions at every stage.</strong></p>
<p>All the time. I don‚Äôt make a stroke that isn‚Äôt a conscious decision. Except when I‚Äôve got enough paint on the picture that I can go strip-strap [gestures] just in order to open up the space a bit, just take a cutter and go across, and not worry too much about where it lands.</p>
<p><strong>The placement of the trees, was that a slow act of deliberation?</strong></p>
<p>Eventually it&#8217;s going to be subject to a lot of second thought. The initial placement is based on the idea of division, going back and coming out again.</p>
<p><strong>You enjoy creating a sense of pictorial depth, don‚Äôt you?¬† In that sense you are rather anti-modernist.</strong></p>
<p>If I have pictorial depth it‚Äôs a fault because I really would like the painting to appear flat. I want everything to come back to the surface.</p>
<p><strong>But you do create perspectives, don‚Äôt you?</strong></p>
<p>You can‚Äôt help it.</p>
<p><strong>I mean you avoid stylized ways of achieving flatness.</strong></p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know how. Have you seen me do stylized paintings which achieve flatness?</p>
<p><strong>No, but I‚Äôve seen Van Gogh do it.</strong></p>
<p>Well, he was a great artist who could do anything. I have a very different space to Van Gogh.</p>
<p><strong>Isn‚Äôt yours more traditional?¬† Closer to an Albertian sense of the picture as a window onto reality?</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôd like to think not but maybe it is. To me it&#8217;s all marks on a surface. One luxury an artist doesn‚Äôt have is to look at his pictures objectively. Let me see if I have something that‚Äôs not Albertian. The thing that started me off with this painting (<u>The Lagoon at Martha‚Äôs Vineyard</u>) was that all of a sudden I had the idea that the horizon isn‚Äôt really a straight line at all, but that it recedes at an angle, and I thought that‚Äôs worth exploring, and I think I got away with it.</p>
<p><strong>It gives a naivete, and tension, to the composition. It‚Äôs interesting that it arises from something you observed in nature.</strong></p>
<p>I observed that, and I observed those blotches on the water which have to do with the sunrise.</p>
<p><strong>Those blotches really go against the pictorial logic; the shapes, the drawing of them, pull one up short. A quality I respond to in your work is this sense of having your cake and eating it, of there being credibly pictorial depth and at the same time an equality of the picture surface. Your teacher Hofmann had that expression he was so fond of, ‚ÄúPush-Pull‚Äù.</strong></p>
<p>I still think of that every now and then, but differently, as a way of just not letting the eye get stuck.</p>
<p><strong>Wherever the eye is, there‚Äôs something next to it which is pulling in a different direction.</strong></p>
<p>You are never allowed to lose the dynamism. When it‚Äôs finally done, though, I want everything to look very natural. I love that statement by Mallarm√©, that the condition to which every work of art aspires is that of having made itself.</p>
<p><strong>This painting (<em>A Path Through Green</em></strong><strong>) shows you at your most reductive in terms of composition, although the eye is given a lot to do with subtleties of tone. There‚Äôs a central blue shape&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>It is supposed to be trees, that is what I thought. What I tried to do here is make a sort of generalized landscape with no particular incident to distract one, but still make a place where you could be.</p>
<p><strong>There‚Äôs a slight sense of the effects one gets in a Rothko here.</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôve said on some occasions, with a certain amount of snideness, that my aim is to do Rothko again, after nature (paraphrasing what C√©zanne said about himself and Poussin).</p>
<p><strong>And how about Pollock? </strong><strong>There‚Äôs tremendous surface tension and agitation in a work like this one (<u>Deciduous</u></strong><strong>) it really pulls everything to the surface. It also de-centers the picture, doesn‚Äôt it?</strong></p>
<p>Right now that is what I am trying very hard to do, to paint an all-over landscape in which there is no hierarchy. It‚Äôs very difficult to do. I was brought up and educated in a particularly hierarchical environment. It‚Äôs one reason why American painting is so interesting: it‚Äôs fought those battles. Pollock is someone I think about a lot, but at the same time I‚Äôm not only working on that one idea. It‚Äôs difficult to paint a Pollock at the Ocean.</p>
<p><strong>Or Rothko in the forest. You mentioned Caspar David Friedrich. You just need a monk here&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>The fact that the monk isn‚Äôt there means a lot.</p>
<p><strong>But wasn‚Äôt it the achievement of Rothko to internalize the monk?¬† So that either the painter or the viewer is the monk?</strong></p>
<p>That‚Äôs the part of Rothko I would disassociate myself from, his pretentiousness. One of my favorite painters is Morandi, because he made modest claims and made them stick, whereas Rothko (and Barnett Newman) made exaggerated claims which didn‚Äôt always stick. I try not to make large claim but I know that I‚Äôm a <em>healthy </em>painter. The virtues that I try represent are things we could have more of without any great harm to the body politic: enthusiasm, consideration, delicacy, subtlety, nuance.</p>
